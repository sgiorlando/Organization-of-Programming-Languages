Name: Scott Giorlando [I did Python and Ada]
My partner was Zachary Palmer [He did C#, Haskell, and Prolog]

------------------------
	  Ada
------------------------
What was easy?

- I didn't find Ada to be easy that much, it was a bit confusing.

What was hard?

- The hardest part about Ada was just figuring out the syntax in general.  I also had issues trying to figure out what did what exactly, so I tried my best when doing my comments to explain that.  It may not be correct but it's definitely my best effort to figure out what's going on.  I also couldn't figure out how to do command line arguments, everyting I tried ended up breaking the program during compilation.

Are there any noticeable differences in speed?

- For Ada programs to work, it's a bit similar to C and C++ when using Unix, where before you run your program you need to compile it, so if there's alot of lines of Code and alot of loops without iterators it may take longer to compile the program you're trying to use.

- Once it was compiled however, it ran pretty much instantly for me.

What do you like/dislike?

- I actually really liked how Ada uses English for it's commands and syntax.  It makes it somewhat easier to understand, and I really like the idea of typing English into your computer for Code, it may actually be easier for people to understand code universally.

- I disliked the way the syntax was for this program, it took me a bit to attempt an understanding of it, and I still feel a bit confused about it.  I feel like I may have the general idea down, but not the tiny details that I would like to know.

Did you find iterators to be helpful?

- I don't even think this implementation used iterators, it used array notation.  I do think iterators would make an easier and better program, and it may reduce compile time.


------------------------
	Python
------------------------
What was easy?

- I found that the syntax was easy to understand and it was very quick to make a program for Python.

What was hard?

- I didn't find anything particularly hard about Python.

Are there any noticeable differences in speed?

- Yes, compared to Ada I found that Python ran very quickly, it was an instant run when I typed the command in on Unix, and I believe this is because I didn't need to compile my program since Python has an interpreter which compiles and runs the code without needing to store the machine code.

What do you like/dislike?

- I really liked Python in general, I found it very easy to understand and read up on, when it came to learning input and output and reading the documentation on specific functions was easy to understand as well.

- There wasn't anything I really disliked about Python.

Did you find iterators to be helpful?

- The function that my program calls uses iterators, and that greatly decreases the run time on my program, since it makes loops alot more efficient.  If I didn't use iterators I feel like my program wouldn't be impacted too much, but if I use larger numbers it may take a bit longer to run if I use a normal loop instead of a iterator.


------------------------
	Haskell
------------------------
What was easy?

- I didn't find much of this language to be easy.

What was hard?
- I found that this language was a bit hard to understand, and I'm fairly certain it's not working 100% either. I had to read up a bit on how to actually implement it to understand what each line was actually saying.

Are there any noticeable differences in speed?

- From what I gather Hasekll is meant to compile fast since every types are composed together by function and if they don't match up then the compiler will fail.  I can see it possibly being an issue when theres alot of functions in the program.

What do you like/dislike?

- I'm not a fan of the syntax of this language and I found it a bit trickier to understand.

Did you find iterators to be helpful?

- This program is short in the amount of code that it has, so an iterator is most definitely helpful if there is one, I did notice the recursion which definitely helps out alot.


------------------------
	Prolog
------------------------
What was easy?

- Prolog seems really easy when it comes to output and iterating since all the work is done for you by Prolog.

What was hard?

- There was a slight issue when it came to actually understanding Prolog, since it's a new language for me.

Are there any noticeable differences in speed?

- For small combinations it was almost instant.  For larger combinations it took longer.

What do you like/dislike?

- I enjoy the the capabilities of Prolog, and I can see where it would be useful.  However, I don't enjoy the minimalistic amount of info there is on the language since it's so hard to grasp.

Did you find iterators to be helpful?

- There were no iterators on this program.


------------------------
	C#
------------------------
What was easy?

- C# is pretty easy to understand since I did do C and C++ before.

What was hard?

- C# has some confusing elements to it that took a little bit of time to understand.

Are there any noticeable differences in speed?

- This program pretty much ran instantly for me in C#.

What do you like/dislike?

- I enjoy how C# has some new interesting things in it besides C or C++, I'm not sure how I feel about Microsoft's website for documentation however, I found some areas a bit confusing where a website like stack overflow can give more information on things in the language.

Did you find iterators to be helpful?

- Yes I found the iterators to be helpful, and they weren't too hard to understand.
